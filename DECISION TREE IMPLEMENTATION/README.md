Project Description : 

-The task is to build a Decision Tree model on a dataset.

  (1) Choosing Dataset : 

    - The dataset is taken from the sklearn module "iris dataset" .
    
    - This dataset is already preprocessed as it is imported from python Module.
    
    - The iris dataset consists of sepal width,sepal length,petal width,petal length ....
    
    - The task is to classify the type ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'].

    - So we will first preprocess it by Handling missing values and Categorical Values.

    - We convert Categorical Values into Numerical values by "Label Encoding" or "Onehot Encoding".

    - And the we Standardize the scale using standardize method from sklearn module.

  (2) Splitting the Dataset :

    - After preprocessing the dataset, the next step is to split the data.

    - The data is split into two set as "Training" and "Testing" datasets.

    - Here I splitted the Training data as 70% and Testing data as 30%.

    - I called the method "train_test_split" from sklearn.model_selection .

  (3) Training the Model [ Decisin Tree ] :

    - The model "Decision Tree" is called as "DecisionTreeClassifier" from sklearn.tree .

    - Decision Tree works by Preparing a tree with the given depth.

    - The node of the tree is the input of the user.

    - The parent and child nodes are the labels .

    - The labels are selected using "GINI INDEX" which the kabel gives more information will be choosen as primary node.

    - AS i gave max_depth = 3 , it will generate a tree of 3 levels other than root node .

    - The model is trained using the training data.

    - Then using the test data ,make the model to predict the outputs .

  (4) Evaluating Accuracy : 

    - The dataset is consist of Categorical values , so accuracy_score is used to find accuracy.

    - for this model the accuracy is 1.0 , which means it give 100% accurately.

  (5) Plotting the Graph and Visualizing the Tree :

    - In this we can use plot_tree method to get the Tree generated by the model .

    - The following images are the graph and Tree.
